1. Why do we use functions in JavaScript?
Functions encapsulate reusable code, improve modularity, and avoid repetition. They allow passing inputs (parameters) and returning outputs. They make code organized and maintainable.

2. What is Function Invocation?
Function invocation is calling or executing a function using its name followed by parentheses `()`. It runs the code inside the function body.

3. Does a function behave like an object in JavaScript? Prove it by an example.
Yes, functions are objects. They can have properties and methods. Example:  
```javascript
function test() {}; test.property = "value"; console.log(test.property); // "value"
```

4. What are Events in JavaScript?
Events are actions like clicks, keypresses, or mouse movements. JavaScript listens for events using event handlers like `onClick` or `addEventListener`.

5. What is a string? 
A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. It is a primitive data type and immutable. Example: `const str = "Hello"`.

6. What is an array? Is it static or dynamic in JavaScript? 
An array is an ordered collection of values. In JavaScript, arrays are dynamic, meaning their size can change at runtime.

7. Difference between Map and Set? 
- Map: Stores key-value pairs with unique keys.  
- Set: Stores unique values only, no duplicates.

8. Difference between Array and Map?
- Array: Ordered collection accessed by numeric indices.  
- Map: Stores key-value pairs with keys of any type.

9. What are array methods? List a few names. 
Array methods are built-in functions to manipulate arrays. Examples: `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `slice()`, `splice()`.

10. In how many ways can we traverse through an array in JavaScript? 
Common ways:  
1. for` loop  
2. for...of` loop
3. forEach()` method  
4. map()` method
5. while` loop
