1. What is JavaScript? 
Web pages can be made interactive with JavaScript, a lightweight interpreted computer language. It makes client-side functionality, animations, and dynamic content possible. Every contemporary web browser supports it.

2. What is the difference between `let` and `var`? 
`var` is function-scoped, whereas `let` is block-scoped, which means it is restricted to the block in which it is defined.  `let` is the ideal option for contemporary JavaScript development since it avoids hoisting problems.


3. Why do we prefer `const` over `var`?  
Because `const` is block-scoped and inhibits reassignment, code is less prone to errors and more predictable.  Declaring constants or values that shouldn't change is preferred.


4. What is the use of JavaScript in web browsers?
JavaScript is used for asynchronous queries (like AJAX), event handling, DOM manipulation, and interactivity.  It makes dynamic content changes possible, which improves the user experience.


5. What are Objects? 
Complex data is stored in JavaScript objects, which are collections of key-value pairs.  They are flexible for simulating real-world entities since they can store properties and methods.


6. What is an array and how is it different from an Object in JavaScript?  
An array is an ordered collection of elements accessed by numeric indices, while an object contains key-value pairs with specific keys. Arrays are good for ordered data, but objects are better for structured data.
7. What is a function? 
A reusable block of code that carries out a particular task is called a function.  It encourages code modularity and reusability by having the ability to take inputs (parameters) and return outputs.


8. How can we implement call by value and call by reference in JavaScript? 
When primitive types (such strings and integers) are provided by value, a copy is made. Since arrays and objects are provided by reference, modifications have an impact on the original object.
9. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?
    number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, and `symbol` are examples of basic data types. They are directly stored in memory and cannot be altered.

11. What is DOM?  
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a tree of objects, allowing JavaScript to manipulate content and structure.

12. Why do we need DOM? 
The DOM enables dynamic interaction with web pages, allowing JavaScript to update content, styles, and structure. It bridges the gap between static HTML and dynamic user interactions.
