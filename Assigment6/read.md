1. What is JavaScript? 
JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive. It enables dynamic content, animations, and client-side functionality. It is supported by all modern web browsers.

2. What is the difference between `let` and `var`? 
`let` is block-scoped, meaning it is limited to the block where it is defined, while `var` is function-scoped. `let` avoids hoisting issues and is preferred for modern JavaScript development.

3. Why do we prefer `const` over `var`?  
`const` is block-scoped and prevents reassignment, making code more predictable and less error-prone. It is preferred for declaring constants or values that shouldnâ€™t change.

4. What is the use of JavaScript in web browsers?
JavaScript is used to add interactivity, manipulate the DOM, handle events, and make asynchronous requests (e.g., AJAX). It enhances user experience by enabling dynamic content updates.

5. What are Objects? 
Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs used to store complex data. They can hold properties and methods, making them versatile for modeling real-world entities.

6. What is an array and how is it different from an Object in JavaScript?  
An array is an ordered list of values accessed by numeric indices, while an object stores key-value pairs with custom keys. Arrays are ideal for ordered data, while objects are better for structured data.

7. What is a function? 
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs, promoting code reusability and modularity.

8. How can we implement call by value and call by reference in JavaScript? 
Primitive types (e.g., numbers, strings) are passed by value, meaning a copy is created. Objects and arrays are passed by reference, meaning changes affect the original object.

9. What are the primitive data types in JavaScript? 
The primitive data types are `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, and `symbol`. They are immutable and stored directly in memory.

10. What is DOM?  
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page as a tree of objects, allowing JavaScript to manipulate content and structure.

11. Why do we need DOM? 
The DOM enables dynamic interaction with web pages, allowing JavaScript to update content, styles, and structure. It bridges the gap between static HTML and dynamic user interactions.
